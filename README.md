🎯 Objective:
To analyze the Titanic passenger dataset and uncover key factors that influenced survival during the disaster.

📁 Dataset:
Titanic dataset from Kaggle, containing information on passengers like age, sex, class, fare, and survival status.

🧹 Data Cleaning:

Handled missing values (e.g., Age and Cabin).

Converted categorical data to numerical format.

Removed irrelevant columns for cleaner analysis.

📊 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):

Analyzed survival rates by gender, age group, and passenger class.

Visualized distributions using bar charts, histograms, and pie charts.

Correlated survival with fare price and family onboard.

📈 Tools & Libraries Used:

Python, Pandas, NumPy for data processing.

Matplotlib and Seaborn for visualization.

📌 Key Insights:

Female passengers had a much higher survival rate.

Passengers in 1st class were more likely to survive than those in 3rd class.

Younger passengers (children) had better chances of survival.

🧠 Conclusion:

Survival was strongly influenced by gender, class, and age.

The analysis reveals social and structural factors affecting rescue decisions.
